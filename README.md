# apa_formatter

## Description

This puppy formats the submitted information by using APA style guidelines. I got really sick of dealing with shitty sites that charge you for APA formatting. So I made my own.
## Todo

* Improve UI/UX of the form. It should be much smaller.
* Add form validation
* Add copy to clipboard of the finalized text.
* Hyperlink URL
* Add multiple authors
* Add different media types
